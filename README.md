The project aims to perform data preprocessing, including data handling, filtering, and transformation, as well as addressing challenges such as handling imbalanced datasets. 
It will explore various machine learning algorithms for data processing, including feature selection procedures, classification methods, clustering techniques, and association rule mining. 
Additionally, the project will focus on building models with clear interpretability, leveraging inductive rule-based approaches and ensemble classifiers. Explaining model decisions and analyzing time series data will be integral parts of the project. 
Deep learning techniques will also be explored for deep data analysis, utilizing architectures suitable for specific applications.
